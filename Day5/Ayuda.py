# The code snippet is removing and returning an arbitrary key-value pair from the dictionary `dic`.
# The `popitem()` method removes and returns the last inserted key-value pair as a tuple. Since
# dictionaries are unordered, the "last inserted" item is arbitrary and may vary between different
# Python implementations or versions.

dic = {'clave1': 100, 'clave2':500}
dic.popitem()
